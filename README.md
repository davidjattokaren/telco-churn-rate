Predicting the Likelihood of Customers Churning from a Telephone Company

Data representing over 7,000 telephone company customers.  The obvious goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn, given a short set of attributes for each customer.


## Target Variable
### Churn
1 if customer churned; 0 otherwise

## Predictor Variables
### senior_citizen
1 if senior citizen; 0 otherwise

### has_dependents
1 if the customer has dependents (likely children); 0 otherwise

### months_as_customer
Number of months the customer was with the company

### has_internet_service
1 if the customer had internet service with the company; 0 otherwise

### has_month_to_month_contract
1 if yes; 0 if no (note: there are other, longer term contracts)
